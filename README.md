# CV Creation Tool

This is an app to create a formatted custom CV and then download it as a PDF.

[Click here for a live demo.](https://jackfcs.github.io/cv-project/)

The app was created using React as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

This is the first full app I've created using React. 

Skills that I've gained from creating this app are:

* Working knowledge of state and props
* Conditional rendering of components
* Binding functions to components
* How to use state and set state to prevent mutating the state directly
